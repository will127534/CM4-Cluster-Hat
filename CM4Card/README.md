# CM4 Card
The PCB board files for the CM4 Card

## Notes
* Because the interconnector is using M.2, the board thickness is limited to 0.8mm
* Yes, I did put most of the components under CM4. The SD card slot is 1.45mm in height. It is fine with the 3mm connector height for the CM4.
* The address for TMP117 is depend on the Cluster Hat.
